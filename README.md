# Malware-Detection-Using-machine-learning

The scope of this paper is to present a malware detection approach using machine learning. In this paper we will focus on windows executable ﬁles. Because of the abnormal growth of these malicious software’s we need to use diﬀerent automated approaches to ﬁnd theses infected ﬁles.

In this project we are going to study and implement a script used for data extraction from the PE-ﬁles to create a data set with infected and clean ﬁles, on which we are gonna train our machine learning algorithms:K-nn, XGBoost and Random Forest.

The last chapter of this paper the algorithms are tested with all the data set features. The accuracy of all algorithms is over 90%. After applying a Feature selection algorithm over the data set, the accuracy has been improved for all the learning algorithms

Inside Malware folder ther a shell.exe file which is malware. You can download it and it is safe. Just before downloading turn off your antivirus.

    1.Download learn.py , chech.py , malware(shell.exe) and dataset zip file.
    
    2.Unzip the file and save all the py file and csv file and malware in same directory.
    
    3.First run your learn.py code which will train your ML algorithm.
    
    4. Now you run check.py 
       eg: python check.y filename.exe
       
ChecK my project report for clarification.
